    <h2 style="color: maroon;font-size:3vw">Demo of how service is invoked by sling model in AEM</h2>


    <h2 style="color:greenry;font-size:2vw">You will see how to call service in sling model, go into crxde and look for node "${currentPage.path}" and delete property by name --> "newProperty(Boolean Property)" and then refresh this page and you will see that property back in the node, This is happening because sling model is calling service, "MyService" and calling its "updateMynode" method which puts this property("newProperty") back into JCR.</h2>
